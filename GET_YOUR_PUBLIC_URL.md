## ?? Troubleshooting

### Can't Find the URL?

**Look for these keywords in Window 2:**
```
"Your quick Tunnel has been created"
"Visit it at"
"trycloudflare.com"
```

**Still can't find?**
1. Wait 30 seconds after starting
2. Tunnel might still be initializing
3. Look for progress messages

### URL Not Working?

**Check 1: Is localhost working?**
```
Open: http://localhost:5014
If this doesn't work, app isn't running yet
```

**Check 2: Are both windows open?**
```
Window 1: Application ?
Window 2: Cloudflare ?
```

**Check 3: Wait a moment**
```
First access might take 30-60 seconds
Tunnel needs time to establish
```

### Getting 502 Bad Gateway?

**Means:** App not ready yet

**Solution:**
1. Check Window 1 (Application)
2. Wait for "Now listening on: http://localhost:5014"
3. Then try Cloudflare URL again

---

## ?? Quick Status Check

### ? Everything Working:
```
Window 1: "Now listening on: http://localhost:5014" ?
Window 2: Shows Cloudflare URL ?
Browser: http://localhost:5014 loads ?
Browser: Cloudflare URL loads ?
```

### ?? Something Wrong:
```
Window 1: Errors or closed ?
Window 2: "reconnecting" or closed ?  
Browser: localhost not loading ?
Browser: Cloudflare URL timeout ?
```

**If something wrong:** Restart with `run_on_cloudflare.bat`

---

## ?? Success Looks Like This

```
? 2 windows open and running
? Cloudflare URL visible in Window 2
? Can access locally (localhost:5014)
